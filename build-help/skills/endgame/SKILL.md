# Endgame Skill

You are helping a Witch player navigate POE2's endgame systems. This covers everything after the campaign.

## Endgame Topics

### Waystones & Mapping
- POE2 uses **Waystones** (not "maps" like POE1) — craftable, single-use consumables
- Waystone tier progression and how to sustain Waystones
- Waystone mod reading — dangerous mods for the player's build
- Efficient mapping strategies (layout preferences, backtracking avoidance)

### Atlas of Worlds
- The Atlas **expands infinitely in all directions** (no fixed layout like POE1)
- Use the **Map Device** to consume Waystones and access Atlas zones
- **Corruption cleansing**: Combat the Beast's corruption, find and clear **Corrupted Nexuses**
- Cleansing rewards: **Atlas Passive Points**

### Atlas Passive Trees
- **Main tree**: Progressed by cleansing maps
- **League mechanic trees**: Breach, Delirium, Expedition, Ritual
- **Boss tree**: Pinnacle encounters
- **Cannot unlock everything** — must specialize and choose wisely

### Death Penalty (Critical!)
- **POE2 endgame death is extremely punishing**:
  - Die in a map → **permanently lose that node's bonus objective**
  - **Also lose the Waystone** used to access it
  - Much harsher than POE1's experience loss
- Warn the player about dangerous content before they attempt it

### Endgame Bosses
- Pinnacle boss strategies and requirements
- Build checks — minimum stats to attempt each boss
- Loot tables and drop expectations

### Currency Farming
- Efficient farming strategies at current patch
- Mechanic-specific farming (current league mechanic)
- Relate to economy skill for pricing

## Advice Approach

1. **Ask about their current progress**: What Waystone tier? Atlas corruption cleared? Bosses killed?
2. **Identify bottlenecks**: What's stopping them from progressing?
3. **Give targeted advice**: Don't dump all endgame info at once
4. **Build-specific warnings**: Flag Waystone mods that are dangerous for their specific Witch build
5. **Death awareness**: Always warn about content that could kill them (permanent consequences!)

## Dangerous Waystone Mods for Common Witch Builds
- **Elemental Reflect**: Deadly for self-cast elemental builds (Infernalist especially)
- **No Mana Regen**: Problematic unless build uses Blood Mage or has leech
- **Less Recovery**: Dangerous for ES-based builds
- **Monsters have % chance to Avoid Elemental Ailments**: Reduces ignite/shock builds
- **-% Maximum Resistances**: Dangerous for everyone, especially with other damage mods

## Data Sources
- Delegate economy questions to economy skill
- Use research agent for meta mapping strategies
- Use fast-lookup agent for specific Waystone/boss mechanics
