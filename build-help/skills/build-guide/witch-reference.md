## POE2 Skill Gem System

**POE2 is completely different from POE1** — gems are NOT socketed into items.

### How It Works
1. Gems have their own **dedicated character interface** (separate from gear)
2. Each character can equip **up to 9 active skill gems**
3. Each skill gem has **2-6 built-in support sockets** (varies by gem)
4. You slot **support gems** into those sockets to customize each skill
5. No socket links on gear — gear has **augment sockets** for Runes, Soul Cores, and Idols

### Gem Types
| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Skill Gems** | Active abilities (attacks, spells, summons) |
| **Support Gems** | Modify a linked skill gem (damage, mechanics, behavior) |
| **Spirit Gems** | Persistent buffs (auras, stances) — cost Spirit resource |
| **Meta Gems** | Advanced conditional triggers |

### How to Get Gems
- **Uncut Gems** drop from enemies and chests (Uncut Skill, Uncut Support, Uncut Spirit)
- Use the **Gemcutting menu** to craft uncut gems into specific gems
- Quest rewards grant specific gems
- No gem vendors like POE1 — more limited access

### Support Gem Tiers
Support gems in POE2 come in **tiers (1-5+)**. Higher tiers provide stronger effects:
- Tier 1: Basic version (e.g., Chain I — adds 1 chain, 50% less damage)
- Tier 5: Powerful version (stronger bonuses, may unlock additional effects)

---

## POE2 Item System

### No Socket Links
- Items do **NOT** have skill gem sockets or links
- Instead, items have **Augment Sockets** for stat-boosting items

### Augment Socket Capacity
| Item Type | Max Sockets |
|-----------|-------------|
| Body Armour | 2 |
| Two-handed Weapons | 2 |
| Other Armour/Weapons | 1 |
| Quivers & Jewelry | 0 |

### What Goes in Augment Sockets
- **Runes**: Stat bonuses
- **Soul Cores**: Monster-themed modifiers
- **Idols**: Build-specific enhancements

### Adding Sockets
- **Artificer Orbs**: Add a socket (collect 10 Artificer's Shards → 1 Orb)
- **Vaal Orbs**: Can add sockets beyond normal limits (risky — may brick item)

---

## Campaign Structure

POE2 currently has **4 Acts + 2 Interludes** (early access). Full release will have 6 acts.

### Resistance Penalties
- **-10% to all Elemental Resistances per act completed**
- After Act 4: **-40% total penalty** to Fire/Cold/Lightning
- **Chaos Resistance is NOT penalized** by campaign progression
- Resistance cap: **75% soft cap, 90% hard cap**

### Chaos Damage Special Rules
- Chaos damage removes **2x Energy Shield** compared to other damage types
- Chaos Resistance is **dynamically doubled** — negative chaos resist is especially dangerous

### Leveling Tips
1. **Acts 1-2**: Focus on one main damage skill + movement skill. Get gems from quest rewards and uncut gem drops.
2. **Act 2**: First ascendancy trial available — prioritize completing it.
3. **Acts 2-3**: Slot support gems into your main skill's built-in support sockets for big damage boosts.
4. **Acts 3-4**: Cap elemental resistances (75% after penalties). Ascendancy trials in Act 3 and 4.
5. **Endgame**: Transition to final build. Get higher-tier support gems, craft gear with Augment Sockets.

### Passive Tree Priority (Leveling)
1. **Life/ES nodes** — survivability first
2. **Damage nodes** for your main skill type (spell, fire, chaos, minion, etc.)
3. **Resistance nodes** if gear isn't capping resists
4. **Mana/regen nodes** — enough to sustain casting
5. **Utility** (cast speed, AoE, duration) — last priority
