## Leveling Gems — Witch

### Act 1 Key Gems
| Gem | Type | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|
| Spark | Lightning Spell | Strong early, good clear |
| Fireball | Fire Spell | Reliable AoE, scales well |
| Raise Zombie | Minion | Early minion option |
| Chaos Bolt | Chaos Spell | Good for chaos builds |
| Frost Bolt | Cold Spell | Pairs with Ice Nova |

### Common Support Gems (Early)
| Support | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| Added Lightning | Adds flat lightning to spells |
| Added Cold | Adds flat cold to spells |
| Concentrated Effect | More AoE damage, less AoE |
| Spell Echo | Repeat spells (faster casting) |
| Minion Damage | Increases minion damage |

### Leveling Tips
1. **Acts 1-2**: Focus on one main damage skill + movement skill. Don't spread too thin.
2. **Acts 2-3**: Start linking support gems to your main skill. 3-link is a big damage boost.
3. **Acts 3-4**: Ascendancy lab becomes available. Prioritize completing it.
4. **Acts 4-6**: Gear becomes more important. Cap resistances (75% each element).
5. **Endgame**: Transition to final build. 5-6 links on main skill, proper flask setup.

### Passive Tree Priority (Leveling)
1. **Life/ES nodes** — survivability first
2. **Damage nodes** for your main skill type (spell, fire, chaos, minion, etc.)
3. **Resistance nodes** if gear isn't capping resists
4. **Mana/regen nodes** — enough to sustain casting
5. **Utility** (cast speed, AoE, duration) — last priority
